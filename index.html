                        SchoolMint acquired Whetstone at the beginning of 2021, and I transitioned from CTO to the Senior
                        Director of Engineering for the positive classroom product line of products, including
                        <a href="https://schoolmint.com/schoolmintgrow/">Grow</a>  (formerly Whetstone),

                        Schoolrunner</a>. I am now responsible for overseeing the development/maintenance of 5 web applications,
                        8 APIs, 3 mobile apps, and all the cloud infrastructure required to run these products.

                        team member to be as productive as possible, ensuring the classroom products are built to the highest
                        standards and are able to scale in order to meet the demand of our rapidly expanding customer base.

                        As the CTO of Whetstone I was responsible for the entire Whetstone platform and development
                        team. I actively wrote code, built & maintained the cloud infrastructure, as well as hired/managed a
                        team of developers. Upon joining Whetstone I inherited a very large monolithic application with a ton
                        of technical debt. I spent my first 2 years rewriting the entire platform. This involved re-writing
                        the application in Typescript/Angular/Node, transitioning from single tenant to multi-tenancy, as well as moving
                        the cloud infrastructure from Heroku to Google Cloud. Whetstone is now hosted in an auto-scaled,
                        load-balanced, Kubernetes cluster that I built and actively maintain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to building and maintaining the platform I also grew the development team from 2 to 6
                        developers. I was responsible for hiring, mentoring, and managing the team while actively contributing code
                        alongside them. Every developer on the team worked as a full stack contributor, including myself.
                        We successfully launched the new Whetstone platform mid-school year in the winter of 2020/2021. Later
                        that year the company was acquired, in large part due to our success building a highly stable, scalable,
                        maintainable platform.

                        Lead engineer for GE Digital Services. My team was responsible for building

                        of GE Power plant assets. I worked closely with the product owners from GE Power to build custom
                        interactive charts & graphs designed to assist engineers responsible for carrying out predictive
                        maintenance on power plant equipment. Our application was built using Angular for the UI, as well as two
                        APIs implemented in Spring Boot.

                    <p>
                        In addition to the responsibilities I had to my team, I actively contributed to the GE "open

                        also participated in the Nola Guilds, which are groups setup to spread knowledge and educate GE
                        developers on technologies and frameworks.

                    <p>
                        At Qonceptual I was responsible for the entire software delivery process. I interfaced with clients
                        who were interested in doing business with Qonceptual to  determine project requirements and the
                        feasibility of the product. I worked a multitude of projects, sometimes on a team, sometimes solo.
                        Every project I have worked on, I have contributed code to every layer of the application.
                        I actively built APIs, web applications, and deployed/maintained applications in Amazon AWS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most recent project I built at Qonceptual was <a href="http://www.pinscout.com"
                                                                            target="_blank">PinScout</a>. This
                        application is comprised of 3 APIs; 1 for delivering content to the consumer facing
                        applications, 1 for payment processing using <a href="http://www.stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a>,
                        and 1 for handling beacons, geofences, and push notifications. I also built 2 web applications;
                        1 for consumers and 1 for the PinScout admins to manage CMS content. I hosted all of these
                        applications using Amazon AWS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My main strength and focus at Qonceptual has been on Javascript engineering. Whether it be
                        Angular/React or Node, I believe Javascript is one of the most powerful languages available for
                        rapid prototyping, which has been my main focus for the past year.

                    <p>
                        At Sparc I was primarily responsible for migrating a monolithic government application from an
                        antiquated jquery web application over to AngularJS. I was given full autonomy to make this
                        effort
                        happen outside of normal processes and was able to deliver a convincing argument to make the
                        move to Angular for the entire project after 2 months of effort. I converted the National Work
                        Queue application over to Angular while it was being actively developed by dozens of engineers.
                        This required me to always stay one step ahead of all the other developers who were on the
                        project for an extended
                        period of time to get the job done.

                    <p>
                        I was also responsible for a sizable portion of the analytics framework for the Veterans Benefit
                        Management System. This was a complex data mining application responsible for querying and
                        aggregating data from a multitude of systems and displaying meaningful graphical representations
                        to the customers at the Veterans Administration. I was responsible for a majority of the UI
                        while also actively developing on the Java API.

                        At Updox I was responsible for rewriting an antiquated UI in Angular as well as maintaining the

                        facing portal, direct encrypted email for practices, and patient payment processing, to name a
                        few. This application was highly complex and required to meet HIPAA standards.
